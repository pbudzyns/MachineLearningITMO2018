"""
It is required to write SVM algorithm without using any libraries and count the f-measure and the confusion matrix
using the developed model.
Next, you need investigate what Wilcoxon test is, use this test to compare kNN and SVM algorithms
and calculate the p-value. You should use old dataset chips.txt (from the first lab).
You should be able to answer any theory questions about SVM and about the statistical test.
